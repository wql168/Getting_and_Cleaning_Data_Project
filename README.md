##Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

Version 1.0


###INTRODUCTION
==================================================================
The requirements for this project are available at: https://class.coursera.org/getdata-010/human_grading/view/courses/973497/assessments/3/submissions

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability of a student to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 

The data for this project is available at: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 

the data was collected by Anguita et al. in a recent experiment carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, the researchers captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The project requires submission of a R script file, a README.md, a code book file, and a tidy data file uploaded to a repo created for this project at github.com.
